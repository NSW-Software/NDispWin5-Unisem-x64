NDispWin Unisem Version 

Readme:
The souce contains 2 project one under AnyCPU and another x86, due to different management of Managed and Native dlls.
All framework and sources are identical except:
- NDispWin.proj -> AnyCPU Build wiht references to 64bit dlls.
- NDispWin x86.proj -> AnyCPU Build wiht references to 32bit dlls.
Edit on the 64bits version, duplicate the project and replace NDispWin x86.proj file and bin folders. Build solution.
